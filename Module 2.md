# Module 2

## Module 2.1 : Languages that make up the web

HTML = Hypertext Markup Language

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

- Responsible for visuals
- Changing the color of the text to controlling the layout

Javascript = Interactivity

- Opening menus, popups, handling dynamic content, etc

These are what makes a website

## Module 2.2 : Intro to HTML

<> = Tags needed to do HTML

`<"Opening Tag">Content<"Closing Tag"/>`

- This is considered to be one element

Semantic HTML = using elements which have semantic meaning

- `<p>` = telling browser its a 'paragraph'

HTML is a markup language (marking up a page)

## Module 2.3 : The root folder and our first HTML file

`my-first-project` = root folder/root directory

`index.html` = first file for the project

Its called index because its what servers automatically go

## Module 2.4 : The doctype, head and body

`<html>` is the root of the document or "root element"

`<head>` is the hidden part of file

Provide extra info about the document

- Author
- Description of the page
- Date the document was published
- ISO
- Shutterspeed

Search engines will see this information

`<body>` is where visitors can see the page

XHTML is XML language and its another markup language

`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that its an HTML5 doc

Fortunately, HTML5 is the final version

## Module 2.5 : Opening our site in the browser

`ctrl + s` or `cmd + s` to save the file

## Module 2.6 : Headings and Paragraphs

To denote the hierarchy of the website, we use heading levels

IMPORTANT: You can only have one h1 per page (Should)

There is h2 to h6 (No h7 or higher)

Formatting:

- h1 = HTML is awesome!
  - h2 = What is HTML?
  - h2 = Basic page structure
    - h3 = The doctype
    - h3 = The head
    - h3 = The body
  - h2 = Marking up your content
    - h3 = Headings
    - h3 = Paragraphs
    - h3 = Lists
